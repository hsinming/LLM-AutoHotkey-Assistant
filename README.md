## Hotkeys

- `Backtick` Show prompt menu
- `Ctrl + S` Save and reload script (when editing)
- `CapsLock + backtick` Suspend/resume hotkeys
- `ESC` Cancel ongoing requests

## Customization

### Adding Custom Prompts

Edit the `prompts` array in the script to add your own prompts.

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Your Prompt Name",
    menuText: "&1 - Menu Text",
    systemPrompt: "Your system prompt",
    APIModel: "model-name",
    isAutoPaste: true,
    isCustomPrompt: true
}]
```

**`promptName`** The name of the prompt. This will also be the Response Window title.

**`menuText`** The name of the prompt that will appear when your press the hotkey to bring up the menu. The ampersand (`&`) indicates that by pressing the character next to it after bringing up the menu, the prompt will be selected. In the example above, pressing the hotkey to bring up the menu (backtick) and then pressing number 1 will select that prompt.

**`systemPrompt`** This will be the initial prompt and will set the tone of the conversation.

**`APIModel`** Get your desired model from the [OpenRouter models website](https://openrouter.ai/models), click on the clipboard icon beside the name, and paste it here.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f46a06-80ca-48b9-94bc-a57d3682a113)

Some example models:

- `openai/o3-mini-high`
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- `deepseek/deepseek-r1`

In addition, you can also append `:online` to *any* model so that it will have the capability to do a web search. More on how it works [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/web-search).

- `openai/o3-mini-high:online`
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:online`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:online`
- `deepseek/deepseek-r1:online`

To enable multi-modal functionality, you can specify different API models, separating them with a comma and a space.

`openai/o3-mini-high, anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:online, deepseek/deepseek-r1:online`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d878c9ab-6145-4aa3-a73c-463fee923459)

This will also enable the `Send message to all models` menu option after pressing the backtick hotkey.

Special feature from OpenRouter: [Auto Router](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/auto)

Your prompt will be processed by a meta-model and routed to one of dozens of models, optimizing for the best possible output. The APIModel is `openrouter/auto`

**isAutoPaste:** Setting this to `isAutoPaste: true` will paste the response from the LLM directly. Remove it if you don't need Auto Paste functionality.

**isCustomPrompt:** Setting this to `isCustomPrompt: true` will allow the prompt to show an input box to write custom messages. Remove it if you don't need Custom Prompt functionality.

**âš  Important:** Make sure to add a comma at the end of the line before the Auto Paste or Custom Prompt functionality, like so:
